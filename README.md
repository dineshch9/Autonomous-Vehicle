Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Control through CNN-based Prediction, Traffic Signal Detection, and Realistic Driving Simulation.Achieved 95% accuracy in predicting throttle &steering angles using a CNN model with 200k parameters, trained on data of 10k
image set. Attained 92% accuracy in detecting and classifying 43 traffic signal classes in the GTSRB dataset using batch generator
and augmentation.
This project simulates automated cars on the Udacity Simulator after training the Sequential CNN Model
